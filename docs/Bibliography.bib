In recent years this has expanded to include retrieval of parts of documents in response to both user queries (passage retrieval) and parts of other documents (automatic hypertext links). The emphasis of SMART has always been on purely automatic text retrieval --- starting from an arbitrary piece of natural language text from the user and matching against automatically indexed documents --- and this continues.},

	abstract = {Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

The solution is characterized to favor the access of the users from diverse locations via mobile devices, from the instrumentation of a distributed architecture and the use of flexible data models. From the operational application, it is feasible to analyze the medical and social data collected in an automated way. Knowledge-based, content-based and collaborative filtering
recommendation techniques are hybridized in a recommender system, which using machine learning and natural language processing is incorporated in order to support the decision-making process. The proposed solution is capable of offering personalized recommendations taking into account the users’ historical data, their behavior and the similarity with other users. The validity of the
solution was verified by the implementation of a functional prototype and a set of experiments},

In 2014, taking advantage of the growing development of the sciences and technologies of information, a new computational solution is developed that allows the sanitary scenarios and ensures user access through the use of a distributed architecture and flexible data models. In spite of the existence of a distributed computational solution of transactional, the impossibility of transforming the stored data properly and taking advantage of the derived information and knowledge in function of the human health care has remained.

Within these algorithms, we find two similar approaches: memory-based (also called neighborhood-based) and model-based. The neighborhood-based are based on the definition of similarity measures, so they are said to have a heuristic approach. The model-based are based on the decomposition of the user-item matrix, made up of the explicit ratings of the users to a set of items already visited and have a more generalized approach. This approach allows discovering existing latent factors between users and items. These methods constitute the state of the art in the recommender systems. The current solution proposes to integrate both approaches and proposes a heuristic for the generation of the initial solution to be used by the optimization algorithm. It is expected to reach accurate recommendations in minor time.},

learning users preferences for items in order to predict the response to a new item.
In order to learn user preferences, they take into account different feedback mechanisms. The most common ways of feedback are numeric ratings and text reviews.
Traditional methods often discard review text. Despite rating based algorithms are
very popular and reach a very good performance, they are not capable of producing
semantically interpretable recommendations. A computational model that takes advantage of both ways of feedback by combining collaborative filtering and natural
language processing approaches is proposed and implemented. Our goal is to build
richer user profiles that allow us to understand recommendations},
